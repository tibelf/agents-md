STOP. What you remember about Vue may be outdated. Always search docs in {docsDir} before any Vue task.
IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for Vue tasks.
PREFER: Composition API with <script setup> for new components.
USE: defineProps, defineEmits, defineModel macros in SFC.
CHECK: reactivity section for ref/reactive patterns.
AVOID: Options API unless maintaining legacy code.
REMEMBER: Vue 3 uses Proxy-based reactivity, not Object.defineProperty.
